## 🚀 Getting Started (Local Setup)

If you're cloning this project, follow these steps to get it running locally.

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/nexus-portal.git
cd nexus-portal
2. Install dependencies
npm install

or

yarn install
3. Set up environment variables

Create a .env file in the root:

cp .env.example .env

Then update it:

EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com

⚠️ This project requires a running backend API (Django or equivalent).
Make sure the API is accessible before running the app.

4. Start the development server
Web
npm run web
Mobile (Expo Go)
npm start

Then scan the QR code using Expo Go.

5. Build for production (Web)
npm run build

Output will be generated in:

dist/

This is what gets deployed to platforms like Vercel.
